## Website Technologies (The Build)

Based on the file structure, this website is built with a focused, vanilla stack.

| Category | Technologies Used | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Structure** | HTML5 (`index.html`) | Semantic markup for content and accessibility. |
| **Styling** | CSS3 (`css/main.css`, `css/reset.css`, `css/media.css`) | Custom, responsive styling without heavy external frameworks. |
| **Interactivity** | Vanilla JavaScript (`js/*.js`) | Handles UI logic, navigation (`skillbar.js`, `main.js`), and form validation (`form.js`). |
| **Backend/Form** | **PHP with PHPMailer** (`mail.php`, `phpmailer/`) | Essential for handling and sending form submissions from the contact section. |
